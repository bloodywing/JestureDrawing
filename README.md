# JestureDrawing
This Java application is meant for artists to use for so-called gesture drawings using **locally stored reference images**. You can set up your own "gesture classes" with individual sessions. Everything is freely configurable.

# Prerequisites
This project relies on my private JsonConfig library. In order to build JestureDrawing from source you'll have to download and publish JsonConfig to your local Maven depository first.
* go to https://github.com/szernex/JsonConfig and download the repository
* execute the gradle task "publishToMavenLocal"
* now you should be able to build JestureDrawing from source

# Requirements
* Java JRE 1.8 or higher
* a local collection of reference pictures
